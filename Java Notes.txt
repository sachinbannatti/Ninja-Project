JAVA :
======
Deffination:
------------
Java is one of the platform indepedent, high level, robust, object oriented, secure programming language.

Background:
-----------
Java was mainly developed by James Gosling in year 1995 in sun micro system and the previuos name of the 
java is oak in year 2009 sun microsystem was changed the name oak to java.

The main features of Java:
--------------------------
1. Platform Idepedent
2. High Level
3. Robust
4. Object oriented
5. Secure
6. Simple

OOPS Concept in Java;
--------------------
Deffination: Object oriented programming is methadology or paradigm to design program by using class and object.

OOPs Concept in Java:
---------------------
1. Object
2. Class
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance
5. Abstarction
6. Encapsulation

1. Object: Object is an entity  which is having both state and behaviour.
Ex: Table, Chaire, Bench Water Bottle etc

2. Class: Collection of object is called as class

3. Polymorphism: A sigle task is performed in different way  is called polymorphism.
Ex: Method Overloading and Method Overriding

4. Inheritance: Inheritance is nothing but it is the process of aquaring  method or varriable or data from parent class
to child class is called inheritence.
Ex:Code Reusebility

5. Abstraction: Hiding the internal details and showing external functionality is called as abstarction.
Ex: Abstract class and Interface

6. Encapsulation: It is the process of binding the code and data togetherly into a single unit is called as encapsulation.
Ex: A java class

Java Varriables: Java Varribles are nothing but these are the memory locations in java.
Types of Java varribles:
1. Local varriables
2. Instance varribles
3. Static varribles
1. Local varribles: The varribles declare inside the body of method is called as local varriables
loacl avrribles cannot declared with name of static keyword

2. Instance varribels: The varribles declare inside the class but outside the body of method are called as Instance varribles

3. Static varriables: The varriables declare with the help of static keyword are called as static varriables
